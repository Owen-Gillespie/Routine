# Routine
The goal of this project is to make an incredibly simple web page to help me (and hopefully you) develop a consistent routine at the start of the morning and late at night.  The contents of the day can be hectic and messy, but the very beginning and end of the day offer us an opportunity to control what happens, and a routine can help make sure that important actions such as taking medication occur consistently.

Currently the site only supports a single routine, and is incredibly ugly. My goal is to be able to have seperate routines for the morning and evening, and some items that only occur on certain days. I am also working on adding a time field for people who need to keep things moving at a certain pace, and tasks with a time will display a progress bar to represent the passage of their alloted time.

Please feel free to submit issues or PRs if you have something that you think would make the site better.
